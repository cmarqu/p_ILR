# se_ILR
a "translation" of ILR for programmers

## motivation
It is really hard to judge fluency in a language. Harder still to judge fluency in programming generally. This is an attempt at a scale for the former, easier problem. The intent is less a tool for hiring (as language specific skill probably shouldn't be our metric) but for learning and leveling in a skill guild.

The scale is modeled on [ILR Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILR_scale):
> a set of descriptions of abilities to communicate in a language. It is the standard grading scale for language proficiency in the Federal service. It was originally developed by the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR), which included representation by United States Foreign Service Institute, the predecessor of the National Foreign Affairs Training Center (NFATC).

## the se_ILR
- [se_ILR Level 0](#se_ilr-level-0) – No proficiency
- [se_ILR Level 1](#se_ilr-level-1) – Elementary proficiency
- [se_ILR Level 2](#se_ilr-level-2) – Limited working proficiency
- [se_ILR Level 3](#se_ilr-level-3) – Professional working proficiency
- [se_ILR Level 4](#se_ilr-level-4) – Full professional proficiency
- [se_ILR Level 5](#se_ilr-level-5) – Core requirements author or contributor

## se_ILR Level 0
The baseline level of the scale is no proficiency, rated 0. The following describes the traits of an ILR Level 0 individual:
> oral production limited to occasional, isolated words

> may be able to ask questions or make statements with reasonable accuracy only with memorized utterances or formulae
> understanding limited to occasional isolated words or memorized utterances in areas of immediate needs.
Knows an isolated, common slice of the core API.

> unable to read connected prose but may be able to read numbers, isolated words and phrases, personal and place names, street signs, office and shop designations
Can basically read the code flow back logically.

> may be able to produce symbols in an alphabetic or syllabic writing system or 50 of the most common characters
Has some rough sense of the syntax sufficient to determine keywords.

## se_ILR Level 1
Elementary proficiency is rated 1 on the scale. The following describes the traits of an ILR Level 1 individual:
> can fulfill travelling needs and conduct themselves in a polite manner

> able to use questions and answers for simple topics within a limited level of experience
Has broad but not deep awareness of the most popular libraries in the industry for a language.

> able to understand basic questions and speech, which allows for guides, such as slower speech or repetition, to aid understanding
Able to navigate the common practices of dependency management for a language.

> has only a vocabulary large enough to communicate the most basic of needs; also makes frequent punctuation and grammatical mistakes in writing of the language
speech is normally very laborious.
Can write basic scripts using core library API.

> The majority of individuals classified as Level 1 are able to perform most basic functions using the language. This includes buying goods, reading the time, ordering simple meals and asking for minimal directions.

## se_ILR Level 2
Limited working proficiency is rated 2 on the scale. A person at this level is described as follows:
> able to satisfy routine social demands and limited work requirements
Can reliably contribute production quality code under normal supervision.

> can handle with confidence most basic social situations including introductions and casual conversations about current events, work, family, and autobiographical information
Has more than cursory knowledge of the popular libraries involved.

> can handle limited work requirements, needing help in handling any complications or difficulties; can get the gist of most conversations on non-technical subjects (i.e. topics which require no specialized knowledge), and has a speaking vocabulary sufficient to respond simply with some circumlocutions
Does not have depth in any library they work with, but knows how to ask for help in the context of the language.

> has an accent which, though often quite faulty, is intelligible
May mischaracterize features of the language, or use analogy to another language, to try to explain what they're doing.

> can usually handle elementary constructions quite accurately but does not have thorough or confident control of the grammar.
Will probably miss idioms that allow easier manipulation of language constructs.

## se_ILR Level 3
Professional working proficiency is rated 3 on the scale. Level 3 is what is usually used to measure how many people in the world know a given language. A person at this level is described as follows:
> able to speak the language with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most conversations on practical, social, and professional topics
Will not mischaracterize language features, and makes use of common idioms to make the most of the language.

> can discuss particular interests and special fields of competence with reasonable ease
Has deep knowledge of a library they use.

> has comprehension which is quite complete for a normal rate of speech
Will likely not need supervision in writing code.

> has a general vocabulary which is broad enough that he or she rarely has to grope for a word
Knows all the common functions, where to look up any they are unsure of, and can read documentation productively without much if any assistance.

> has an accent which may be obviously foreign; has a good control of grammar; and whose errors virtually never interfere with understanding and rarely disturb the native speaker.
May not write the most concise or fluid code, but has no issues with syntax or misusing constructs.

## se_ILR Level 4
Full professional proficiency is rated 4 on the scale. A person at this level is described as follows:
> able to use the language fluently and accurately on all levels and as normally pertinent to professional needs.
> can understand and participate in any conversations within the range of own personal and professional experience with a high degree of fluency and precision of vocabulary

> would rarely be taken for a native speaker, but can respond appropriately even in unfamiliar grounds or situations
Does not know the internals of how the language was written. For higher level languages may not have much experience in how low level constructs of it are used, ie. garbage collection.

> makes only quite rare and minute errors of pronunciation and grammar

> can handle informal interpreting of the language.
Solid and productive code reviewer.

## se_ILR Level 5
Native or bilingual proficiency is rated 5 on the scale. A person at this level is described as follows:
> has a speaking proficiency equivalent to that of an educated native speaker
Has made some contributions to the core of the language.

> has complete fluency in the language, such that speech on all levels is fully accepted by educated native speakers in all of its features, including breadth of vocabulary and idiom, colloquialisms, and pertinent cultural references.
Is the primary author of the language.
