# se_ILR
a "translation" of ILR for programmers

## motivation
It is really hard to judge fluency in a language. Harder still to judge fluency in programming generally. This is an attempt at a scale for the former, easier problem. The intent is less a tool for hiring (as language specific skill probably shouldn't be our metric) but for learning and leveling in a skill guild.

The scale is modeled on [ILR Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILR_scale):
> is a set of descriptions of abilities to communicate in a language. It is the standard grading scale for language proficiency in the Federal service. It was originally developed by the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR), which included representation by United States Foreign Service Institute, the predecessor of the National Foreign Affairs Training Center (NFATC).
